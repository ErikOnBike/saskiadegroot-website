Kids' Coach Drawing</h2><p>The drawing tells a lot and that drew my attention. I specialised to become a Kids’ Coach through Drawing (June 2017).</p><h2>... MatriX coach</h2><p>I followed the training with Ingrid Stoop. I learned to help others in an effective and quick way, a style that fits my personality. Since October 2016 I am a certified MatriX coach.</p><h2>... fan of Jung</h2><p>In August 2015, I started a 3-year study with Stichting Odrerir: ‘Symbolical psychology of C. G. Jung’ which is the base of my theoretical background knowledge.</p><h2>... Happiness Ambassador</h2><p>The Dutch foundation “De Gelukskoffer” promotes her program to make children aware that 40% of their happiness is in their own hands. It will give children more energy when they realise this.</p><h2>... Specialist Creatieve Communication</h2><p>In 2005, my passion for the children’s drawing started. I followed courses at Le Bon Départ, Bauk Zwaan and a 2-year study at the Kolam (School for ‘Healing though Drawing’). In 2013, I got my degree as a Specialist Creative Communication. In 2014, I took private classes and supervision meetings with Odilia Klein-Koerkamp-Solen.</p><h2>... Kids’ Skills Ambassador</h2><p>In 2009, I followed the study Kids’ Skills. This is a worldwide method to see children as persons who need to learn a new skill and to not see them as persons with a problem.</p><h2>... mother</h2><p>In 2011, with a young daughter I searched for new challenges close to home. I combined being a mum, a teacher, and during school holidays a bicycle guide. As a family, we also love to travel by bicycle.</p><h2>... teacher</h2><p>In 2005 I successfully completed the PABO to get my teaching credentials for the primary school. I still work as a teacher on a part time basis.</p><h2>... National Guide</h2><p>With lots of pleasure I followed the HBO study ‘National Guide’ for 4 years till 1995. I guided among others for Cycletours Holland, the Muiderslot castle and Bike &amp; Barge Holland Tours. For the latter I was part-owner and responsible for tasks in the Netherlands till 2010. I still guide, it still is a passion.</p>"
