Kids' Coach Drawing</h2><p>The drawing tells a lot and that drew my attention. I specialised to become a Kids’ Coach through Drawing (June 2017).</p><h2>... MatriX coach</h2><p>I followed the training with Ingrid Stoop. I learned to help others in an effective and quick way, a style that fits my personality. Since October 2016 I am a certified MatriX coach.</p><h2>... fan of Jung</h2><p>In August 2015, I started a 3-year study with Stichting Odrerir: ‘Symbolical psychology of C. G. Jung’ which is the base of my theoretical background knowledge.</p><h2>... Happiness Ambassador</h2><p>The Dutch foundation “De Gelukskoffer” promotes her program to make children aware that 40% of their happiness is in their own hands. It will give children more energy when they realise this.</p><h2>... Specialist Creatieve Communication</h2><p>In 2005, my passion for the children’s drawing started. I followed courses at Le Bon Départ, Bauk Zwaan and a 2-year study at the Kolam (School for ‘Healing though Drawing’). In 2013, I got my degree as a Specialist Creative Communication. In 2014, I took private classes and supervision meetings with Odilia Klein-Koerkamp-Solen.</p><h2>... Kids’ Skills Ambassador</h2><p>In 2009, I followed the study Kids’ Skills. This is a worldwide method to see children as persons who need to learn a new skill and to not see them as persons with a problem.</p><h2>... mother</h2><p>In 2011, with a young daughter I searched for new challenges close to home. I combined being a mum, a teacher, and during school holidays a bicycle guide. As a family, we also love to travel by bicycle.</p><h2>... teacher</h2><p>In 2005 I successfully completed the PABO to get my teaching credentials for the primary school. Up till 2017 I worked as a teacher on a part time basis.</p><h2>... National Guide</h2><p>With lots of pleasure I followed the HBO study ‘National Guide’ for 4 years till 1995. I guided among others for Cycletours Holland, the Muiderslot castle and Bike &amp; Barge Holland Tours. For the latter I was part-owner and responsible for tasks in the Netherlands till 2010. I still guide, it still is a passion.</p>"

Put cirkels on paper and connect them with flowing lines. It is interesting to see how each brain shows different results. Eg. How full is it literally up there in the head of the creator?<br>2. Circles. How do these&nbsp;devide themselves on paper?&nbsp;<br>3. Pentagons. The 5-cornered shape is the basis of this meditative set up.<br>4. Animal template. What animal do you choose&nbsp;and how do you use the template?<br>5. Free choice.</p><p>All&nbsp;results&nbsp;are so different, so personal.<br>Lots of happy colouring!</p><p>The sales of 100 colouring books is going well. &nbsp;The total revenue will go to the Children's Department of Tergooi Ziekenhuis.
