Kids' Coach Drawing</h2><p>The drawing tells a lot and that drew my attention. I specialised to become a Kids’ Coach through Drawing (June 2017).</p><h2>... MatriX coach</h2><p>I followed the training with Ingrid Stoop. I learned to help others in an effective and quick way, a style that fits my personality. Since October 2016 I am a certified MatriX coach.</p><h2>... fan of Jung</h2><p>In August 2015, I started a 3-year study with Stichting Odrerir: ‘Symbolical psychology of C. G. Jung’ which is the base of my theoretical background knowledge.</p><h2>... Happiness Ambassador</h2><p>The Dutch foundation “De Gelukskoffer” promotes her program to make children aware that 40% of their happiness is in their own hands. It will give children more energy when they realise this.</p><h2>... Specialist Creatieve Communication</h2><p>In 2005, my passion for the children’s drawing started. I followed courses at Le Bon Départ, Bauk Zwaan and a 2-year study at the Kolam (School for ‘Healing though Drawing’). In 2013, I got my degree as a Specialist Creative Communication. In 2014, I took private classes and supervision meetings with Odilia Klein-Koerkamp-Solen.</p><h2>... Kids’ Skills Ambassador</h2><p>In 2009, I followed the study Kids’ Skills. This is a worldwide method to see children as persons who need to learn a new skill and to not see them as persons with a problem.</p><h2>... mother</h2><p>In 2011, with a young daughter I searched for new challenges close to home. I combined being a mum, a teacher, and during school holidays a bicycle guide. As a family, we also love to travel by bicycle.</p><h2>... teacher</h2><p>In 2005 I successfully completed the PABO to get my teaching credentials for the primary school. Up till 2017 I worked as a teacher on a part time basis.</p><h2>... National Guide</h2><p>With lots of pleasure I followed the HBO study ‘National Guide’ for 4 years till 1995. I guided among others for Cycletours Holland, the Muiderslot castle and Bike &amp; Barge Holland Tours. For the latter I was part-owner and responsible for tasks in the Netherlands till 2010. I still guide, it still is a passion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Logo</h1><p>I designed the logo based on my three fields of work.</p><p>... The drawing is represented by the paint stripes and colours.

I enter the contact information you have provided, consisting of name and email address. If provided, address, postal code and place of residence are also saved, but this information is optional.

A photo stop at the <a href=\"https://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/locations/rietveld-schroder-house/\">Rietveld-Schröderhuis</a> is a must and after that we are quickly out of town. The <a href=\"https://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/locations/rietveld-schroder-house/\">canoe rental</a> looks very inviting, but we follow the Kromme Rijn just cycling. The birds seem to whistle harder around Fort Rhijnauwen and the Amelisweerd forest. Meanwhile, the weather is lovely for a coffee with some goodies outside on the terrace of the organic <a href=\"http://www.veldkeuken.nl/index.php\">Veldkeuken</a> next to Oud Amelisweerd (<a href=\"https://www.moa.nl/en/VisitorInfo\">museum MOA</a>). With a green loop we cycle past <a href=\"http://fortvechten.nl/\">Fort Vechten</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.romeinselimes.nl/wat-is-de-romeinse-limes/het-weten-waard/redactieteam/wie-woonden-er-allemaal-in-het-romeinse-castellum-fectio\">Roman Castellum Fectio</a> and Lunetten back to the Utrecht Central Station. A successful cycle loop with body!</p>",

Two workshop rounds followed, which included me.<br><br>A whole group of teachers has now been able to see and experience how important the drawing is and what it might tell you. A child shows so much information in his or her drawing language, which for example will never appear from a coloring sheet. The freedom to draw is sometimes even hard to adapt to for students, who are used to act within the limited lines, the boundaries of such a coloring sheet.<br>I make the teachers draw a house on large or smaller paper, with pencil, wax crayon or felt-tip pen. Sometimes it felt annoying or not convenient to be obliged to use what is given to you. Experience shows that each assignment requires its own material, or maybe even a free choice is desirable.<br>I briefly discussed the stages in the development of children's drawing to round of the workshop. Very useful for placing a child at a socio-emotionally level.<br><br>The feedback was lovely. Some teachers were captured in such a way that there will certainly be a follow up. Especially awareness has been created. My goal has been achieved!</p>",

This results in 1014 groups per week. Sometimes there are more than 48 groups per hour</i>. Mostly these tours are focussed on the Red Light District and all the corresponding highlights. Tour groups, drunk groups of young men, just too many tourists and no one showing respect for the ladies working and inhabitants of these neighbourhoods.</p><p>I got my guiding permit this year. In 2019 I may guide groups up to 20 people through this 'zone'. A month ago I received a letter from the city council that my permit will no longer be valid till 11pm, but till 7pm. That works for me. But as of 2020 no group with guides are allowed any more. Too bad reality leads to no more walking on the gorgeous Zeedijk, over the Nieuwmarkt and along 'Our Lord in the Attic' museum. The history of this part of Amsterdam has captured my heart. So sad I cannot share that any longer in the future. That history in a nut shell and not the Red Light District is what I got my permit for. I hope that permit remains for the areas without 'windows' for the few times a year that I am there with a group. Although I do understand the problem totally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The classes are small, students all have their own requirements and this workshop is a change in the standard routine. Still all are joining in wonderfully. The fun thing is always to start off scribbling, using one colour while counting down from 10 to zero. Swapping colours and go again. What a great way to relief tension, emotions and get grounded. They are ready for step 2. The first two groups cut out a vase from their scribbles. The flowers are made of infinity signs combined horizontally and vertically. This brain gym is a big enough challenge for most. The back ground is painted with a few colours of ecoline. The students love to put on aprons and create a mixture of colours with a brush. Something they don't do frequently. The vase and flowers are glued on, stims are added et voilá ... Spring time is here.</p><p>The third group made an egg from their scribbles. That egg is bursting open and shows what bird is coming out. Knowing the language of drawing it is wonderful to see the different set ups by all students, perfectly fitting their personality according to the teachers that I spoke to. It was a great morning for all.</p>",

And isn't it amazing to learn it is my 80th tour for this company! I was surprised myself.... but after all it adds up after 1995.</p><p>Saturday 20 April all tourist boarded in the Oosterdok in Amsterdam, turning into a lovely group. Sailing towards the Amsterdamse Bos, to get away from traffic. All these days it is delightful to ride along the winding peat rivers, lakes, villages, trees turning green. And true in the meadows towards the Unesco mills of Kinderdijk, there are definitely less migrating birds to be seen than during my first rides long ago. Kinderdijk was not a good idea anyway on Easter Sunday. IT IS BUSY. Too many tourists, and of course we are tourists too. But it feels different. Exploring the country slowly on our bikes for two weeks. It feels that we belong more ... not true of course.</p><p>The tulips fields, the street organ museum in Haarlem, Koningsdag in Bergen, windy rides on Texel island, more flowers in Westfriesland and the lighthouse of Marken brought us back to Amsterdam. Like always I take the group on a city walk. Not the common Tuesday morning when I tend to be there, but a Wednesday afternoon. And yes.... we are just another group. My goodness, IT IS BUSY. The permit I have to guide downtown is up to 20 people. I have 23. So a swirl around the Nieuwmarkt zone. But even around there I get yelled at by a local cyclist: 'Maximum 5 !!'. Referring to the 5 people one may guide in the zone wihout a permit. Even while I do nothing wrong and my group is not walking on the street but on the side walk, I do feel this remark. And I understand the locals. Next time I will walk another walk that will lead tourists away from the centre but into the next neighbourhoods. Good?! Maybe we should try avoiding the crowded cities and national highlights. To feel free as a tourist cyclist normally feels, including the feeling to be welcome. Which we happily excperience 99% of the time. In September I will come again and I am looking forward to it!</p>",

Already the 20th-edition, an anniversary for this mega-organisation. Volunteers make it possible to host a great evening for about 5000 people! An evening together, an evening that is not once dominated by that ever-present disease. I myself am already sitting at my drawing table for ten people when I hear the sirens. The streets are closed off. The red carpet is out. The families mainly come from North Holland, brought by ambulances, fire engines or police cars. That alone will make their evening! Soon after half past five the first family arrives. They want to draw. I have two assignments in mind for tonight. About animals, of course, because with the elephants, lions and lemurs as a neighbour, it cannot be otherwise. Everyone 'dances' on his or her paper with wax crayons and looks for an animal in it. Or the whole family puts a line, dot or scribble on paper that is passed on. When the paper returns to the owner, an animal is made with coloured pencil based on those signs. It is wonderful. Both the results and the atmosphere. Thankful children, relaxed mothers, fathers who disappear in their artwork. They are pulled away by the children, because there is much to experience: music ... children's yoga ... a printing press ... djembe ... and of course the zoo. An experience for me to never forget, in the most beautiful place ever. Great that my neighbour (organisation) asked me to participate!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Great feeling to end the day and continue coaching in my own practice.</p><p>So far my coaching works the best by drawing and then combine the MatriX method. Example: <i>A boy suffered from all outside influences. It came to him like a noise. I saw in his drawing that it totally controlled him (picture 1). Because he named it as a sound, he visualised/made buttons on his ears and then drew them. A volume button and a channel selection button (picture 2). He felt much more calm.

Right so, Holland. Holland consists of 2 provinces North- and South Holland. These 2 provinces are part of the whole country being the Netherlands. To make it easy we talk about Holland in general, just an easier word to say, a name more known abroad. But if you meet someone from Groningen province they may rightfully say, 'I am not from Holland!'</p><p>Seeing the same route this year but in two different seasons. Spring and Fall. In April we could see through gardens as the folliage was not fully out yet. Gorgeous farmhouses along water could easily be admired. In September the lush green was overwelming and gardens looked still beautiful. The large tourist groups had left, quite a relief because Easter and Tulip time do attract big crowds of people. We now had time to see other things then flowers. The King&amp;queen at Prinsjesdag, the beach at Noordwijk, the Cruquius museum and more time for beautiful Haarlem. And the odd field of lilies were like a cherry on the pie.</p>",

We walk past almshouses, serene canals and wealthy buildings that mirror the past wealth of the United East India company. At the Rode Steen square we enjoy a coffee break in the old weighing house.
